# Random Forest Classifier Model For Prediction Task

This repository contains the implementation of Random Forest Classififier for predicting task. The dataset to be used in this repository is [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). In this code, there are some techniques to handle dataset and modeling, such as cleaning dataset, handle missing values, label encoding, feature selection, splitting train-set and val-set, find the best hyperparameter for model, and so on.

## About
This code implements the most simple and basic techniques about Machine Learning, so it's very widely opened for improvement. This code was run on Kaggle Notebook using accelerator "GPU T4 x2". The total time consumed for this code was "151.2 s", the model has **accuracy = 86%** and **f1-score = 81%**.

## Requirements
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
